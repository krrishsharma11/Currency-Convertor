# Currency-Convertor
developed a fully functional Currency Convertor App
This is a Currency Converter application built using React Native . The app allows users to view live currency rates and convert currencies in real-time with a user-friendly interface. While developing the app, one of the major challenges faced was accessing the right API platform for currency exchange data, as many sources required paid subscriptions. After some research, I successfully integrated a reliable API to deliver accurate and live data, ensuring functionality without any cost barriers.
